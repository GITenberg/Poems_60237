<h4><a id="PREFACE">PREFACE</a></h4>


<p>Most or these verses have appeared in the papers&mdash;<i>The Nation, New
Statesman, Cambridge Magazine</i>&mdash;to the editors of which I tender
customary dues. Also, in 1917, a dozen were brought together to
make a little book, <i>Ad Familiares</i>, of which a hundred copies
were printed privately. Of these seventy were immediately distributed
amongst my friends, while the remaining thirty have drifted into
the hands of curious amateurs who wrote and asked for them. My
stock is now exhausted; but apparently the stock of amateurs is not:
for, from time to time, still reach me civil requests for a copy. What
can I do? On the one hand, my vanity is outraged by the idea of people
anxious but unable to read me; on the other, I am too mean to print
for their benefit at my own expense. What I have done is to accept
with joy an offer by the Hogarth Press to publish a complete edition
of my poems&mdash;seventeen in number. Thus, in future, without being at
pains to write a flattering letter, and at a trifling cost, any amateur
can acquire the works of an extremely rare poet.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 1em;">And so he laboured very hard,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Piled little card on little card</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And laughed to see how well it stood,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">How all his work was sure and good</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And pretty as a minaret.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He shone with pleasure. "Now I'll set</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A jolly cap to crown the thing."</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He clapped his hands. Perhaps the fling,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Perhaps the shout was over-daring;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It toppled down while he was staring.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">One had to titter, willy-nilly,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To see him look so sad and silly.</span></p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Here in a garden under vines</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Translucent in the mid-day sun,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Washing, green shutters, and the lines</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of the <i>Salute</i>, which is fun</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And pure baroque to men of taste,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I'm waiting&mdash;while the pot-boy chaste</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or chastish since Ignatius Chowne</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And J. A. Symonds to this town</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Have taught Italian history&mdash;waiting,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I say, while he is regulating</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A "<i>conto</i>" of 12.50-Change</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For 50 lire; it is strange</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In "<i>tutto il viale bello</i>"</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In which the shops are small but thrifty</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">There's not a single honest fellow</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To furnish 37.50.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I'm waiting still, and still I ponder,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As I have pondered all the morning,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Out on the blue <i>Giudecca</i> yonder,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Under the arches, listless, yawning</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Full-mouthed against precocious summer</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That's sprung this quick surprise upon us,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And found us out, the sly new-comer,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Tweed-coated, winter-hosed, astonished&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I ponder, knowing all the time</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The answer, ponder for the pleasure</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of fitting fancy into rhyme</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And matching music with the weather,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What lacks when sea and sky conspire</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With form as thin but more romantic</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Than that which some of us admire</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At Covent Garden,&mdash;Transatlantic</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Cousins still call it monumental,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But we know better&mdash;sentimental</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">People divine a riddle basking</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Under its marble,&mdash;never mind them,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Be sure they'll come, their tales behind them,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Safe home to Chelsea. Still I'm asking:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"What's lacking yet?" The Spring's awake,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Each palace curtsies to her neighbour,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Each gondolier's a handsome rake,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Each mouth-organ a dulcet tabor;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What can I want when Venice plays</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And Time's a song, and Fate's a dancer,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And Life drifts gaily down her ways,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What's lacking, Madame? Can you answer?</span></p>

<h4><a id="TO_AVS_WITH_A_BOOK"><i>TO</i> A.V.S. WITH A BOOK</a></h4>


<p><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Books are the quiet monitors of mind,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They prompt its motions, shape its ways, they find</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A road through mazes to the higher ground,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whence to explore the sky-bound marches. Round</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">About us lie the open downs. Our days</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Still ask a guide and goad. Wherefore always</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We meditate wise thoughts and passionate lays;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Wherefore I send a book.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Books are the mind's last symbol. They express</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Its visions and its subtleties&mdash;a dress</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Material for the immaterial things</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That soar to immortality on wings</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of words, and live, by magic of the pen,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where dead minds live, upon the lips of men</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And deep in hearts that stir. Wherefore do I,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Drawing a little near, prophetically,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Send you a book.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Books are the heart's memorial. They shall measure,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In after days, our undiscovered treasure,&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thrilling self-knowledge, half-divined untold</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Yearnings, and tongueless agonies, shall unfold</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or half unfold to half-illumined eyes.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The cypress shadows creeping gnomonwise</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Still stretch their purple fingers down the hill</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That hangs above Fiesole; and still</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Your English fireside glows. Do you most dear&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sometimes just guessed at, sometimes very near&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Yet always dear and fairest friend, do you</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Recall the sunlight and the firelight too?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Recall the pregnant hours, the gay delights,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The pain, the tears maybe, the ravished heights,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The golden moments my cold lines commend,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The days, in memory or which I send</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A book?</span></p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 1em;">It was the thrush's song I heard</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To-day, in March. And you who came</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At life through books, whom poets stirred</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To love of beauty, who the name</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of art revered and fancy knew</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From earliest days,&mdash;why, how should you</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Guess at my feelings when among</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The elms I heard the thrush's song?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For you the country means a mood,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Recalls a poem, lays a scene;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For you its beauties are more good</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sometimes than paintings: it has been</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Music to calm or move you, still</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A background to your thought and will.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nothing for me the country means:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It is. The thrush's earliest song</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the precocious sunshine cleans</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My soul of culture. Comes along</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The acrid smell of daffodil,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Hard from the soil still wet and chill.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">These do not mean. I am content</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To look or listen, passion spent,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Far beyond art and thought, and free</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From Vanity and Jealousy,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As free as flower, or bird, or tree,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Not to mean anything, but be.</span></p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And troubled her dream of fair content;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He tempted the timorous blossoms to birth,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The poor pink fools that laughing went</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of the pensive sea he ravished away;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He twitched it from her, and gave instead</span><br />

<h4>WHO SENT ME A PIECE OF GOOD NEWS
IN A RHYMED LETTER</h4>

<h5><i>Wittering, April</i> 1915</h5>


<p><span style="margin-left: 1.8em;">When all the world was very good</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(So says the nursery rhyme)</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The fairy Fays and Mays who stood</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As godmothers, from time to time,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Would give their virtuous picaninnies</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A golden goblet filled with guineas.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.8em;">That was the golden age: and nurse</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Declared that ours grew worse and worse</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">("Don't bite the spoon, Miss Leslie!")</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Yet I believe that fairies still</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Can fill a cup, and over-fill,&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At any rate in Chelsea.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.8em;">Telling good news is reckoned kind</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(Except when Germans tell it,)</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To wrap it in a pleasant rind</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of song was thought angelic</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By the good shepherds, and by me</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A piece of sweet <i>diablerie.</i></span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.8em;">One cavil: though it ill becomes</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">One who has in his time</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Bedragged the depths and skimmed the scums</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To catch a dubious rhyme,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To scold a poetess who fell</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And, though she knew she shouldn't,</span><br />

<p><span style="margin-left: 1em;">No: I was not made for love;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I was made for easier things,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ecstasies on paper wings,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Agonies that end in laughter</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&mdash;Smoke or kisses coming after&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Not for love.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I was made for airy thinking,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nimble sallies, champagne-drinking,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Badinage and argument,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Reading's infinite content,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ill-considered merriment,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Friendship, anything but love.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Made for singing little songs,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Made for righting little wrongs,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Made to taste whate'er there be</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of loveliness and gaiety</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On this variegated earth;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Made for sentiment and mirth</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And light romance, perhaps just worth</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A smile from Art, a nod from Truth,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I, apt for a fantastic youth</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of follies, an old age of thought,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And never thinking to be caught</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As now I am, said "Never mind</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Love, for Love, you know, is blind."</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I was made with eyes to see,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And taste to choose fastidiously,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And ears to hear, enough of brain</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To make most matters fairly plain,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Enough of health for work or play,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of wealth enough to pick my way,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sense to enjoy, and arts to bring</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Soft nothings off a softer thing,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A turn of wit, a taste for ease,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And what had love to do with these?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I was made to revel in</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The viola and violin,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The broad bassoon and clarinette,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From every art devised to get</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Its complement of melody:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Believe me, I was meant to be</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">One who smiled back at smiling faces,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A loiterer in life's pleasant places,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A well of receptivity.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I was contrived by God to pull</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The noses of the very dull;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Tweak up as 'twere a cotton gown</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The law most solemnly laid down;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Expressly charged to mock the great</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And weather-cockwise still girate.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To choose a rose and praise a frill,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And sometimes cause a tiny thrill,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To be a lover in my fashion&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But O! I was not made for passion.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Therefore, dear Lady, if you please</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Deal very gingerly with these.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Here is our garden: O, take care</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Our passion spoil not our parterre.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Be gracious, Madame, lest your frown</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Should bake the lawns and burn them brown,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Be very kind, or jealous showers</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">May quite dash down our scented flowers,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And O! be chary of reproof,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Remember I'm not made for love.</span></p>

(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or

Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
